# SpringBoot_JWT_Authorization
user-management-system project : 
we will have login, register pages and users can sign-in and sign-up from those pages then we can list all users and we can see the details of users.
And we will implement this project using Spring Boot, Angular, and MySQL.

the project contains also CRUD operations will be for users. We will use users for user sign-in, sign-up and authorization operations.
Also, we will go on with the role based application. So we will use different roles like “Admin”, “User”. User role will have typical operations like login, register.

But admin role will have some specific operations like to list all users. Then we will provide different authorizations to these users according to the role.
